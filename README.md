# Israeli-Palestinian_Conflict_Analysis
This report analyses fatalities in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from 2000 to 2023.

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict dates back to the end of the 19th century. The conflict began with the 1947 United Nations Partition Plan, which sought to divide the British Mandate of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states. The plan was never implemented and provoked the 1947â€“1949 Palestine War.

The current Israeli-Palestinian status quo began after the 1967 Six-Day War, when Israel militarily occupied the West Bank and Gaza. Israel has launched four military assaults on Gaza: in 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021.

Renewed violence in the region started on May 6, 2021, when Palestinians protested against an anticipated decision of the Israeli Supreme Court to evict six Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah in occupied East Jerusalem.
